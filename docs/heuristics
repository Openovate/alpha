After clustering pages possible next actions are:

- Process further clustered data by analyzing text
  that contains hints for example if we are targeting
  the title, the title must not contain words that a
  detail, a brand, a category or a specification / 
  attributes could contain,

  further explanation:

  Title:
  Samsung Galaxy S6

  Description:
  Product Details for Samsung Galaxy S6

  Specifications:
  Specification of Samsung Galaxy S6

  Brand:
  Sold by : Samsung

  We can identify the title if the text does
  not contain "Product Details for", "Specification of",
  "Sold by" etc.

- Prices can be processed in a heuristic way,
  if the text contains sign, or is decimal formatted
  or is near the title and image block or is strikethrough etc..
